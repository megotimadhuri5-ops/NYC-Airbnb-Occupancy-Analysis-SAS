# NYC Airbnb Occupancy & Performance Analysis Using SAS

## Project Overview
This project analyzes NYC Airbnb listings to identify high-performing and underperforming properties using SAS visual analytics. Occupancy was inferred using annual availability data.

## Objectives
- Classify Airbnb listings into occupancy levels
- Identify top-performing neighborhoods
- Analyze room type performance
- Highlight underutilized listings

## Tools Used
- SAS Studio
- SAS Visual Analytics (Tasks, Filters, Charts)

## Methodology
- Used availability_365 as a proxy for occupancy
- Created occupancy categories (Highly Occupied, Moderately Occupied, Low Occupancy)
- Performed frequency analysis and summary statistics
- Analyzed performance by neighborhood and room type

## Key Findings
- Over 50% of listings are highly occupied
- Brooklyn and Manhattan show the highest occupancy
- Private rooms and entire homes perform better than shared rooms
- A significant number of listings remain underutilized

## Business Impact
The analysis provides insights for hosts and property managers to optimize pricing, availability, and listing strategy.
